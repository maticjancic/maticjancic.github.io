	abstract = {In the Mediterranean, the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) has exhibited increase in the number of nests over the past two decades. While the Eastern Mediterranean is recognized as a high use area, scarce observations of green turtles in Adriatic Sea suggested only low-level utilization of this area. This study presents new findings of green sea turtles in the Adriatic Sea and analyses the importance of the region for the species. In combination with published records, we present 75 findings of the species in the Adriatic including eight new records. The number of records is generally low but shows an intriguing ten-fold increase since 2000. This may be a result of three confounding factors: (i) positive population trend at main nesting sites in Mediterranean; (ii) increased institutional capacity for sea turtle research and conservation in the past two decades, and (iii) raising sea temperatures. Documented increases in the sea surface temperatures may have established suitable and recurring thermal corridors along Ionian-Adriatic developmental pathway and provided environmental cues for immigration of juvenile green turtles into the Adriatic. As the abundance of the species will likely increase in the future, research and conservation efforts will be needed to avoid the Adriatic Sea becoming a sink habitat for the Mediterranean green turtle population.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to shed light on distribution patterns and the relationship between species diversity and environmental heterogeneity of 17 Edraianthus taxa. We examined present and past distributions (Last Glacial Maximum) by applying ecological niche modelling. The environmental space occupied by the taxa was analysed using niche comparison methods. The results support the idea that the central and southern Dinaric Alps represent a centre of diversity and endemism in the western Balkan Peninsula. Diversity in Edraianthus is best explained by topographic (slope) and bioclimatic predictors (maximum temperature of warmest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of warmest quarter, precipitation of coldest quarter), suggesting that mountain areas with the most diversified relief have higher diversity. Niche modelling results suggest considerable range dynamics during the climatically unstable Quaternary. Thermophilic and lowland taxa responded with longitudinal shifts to ecologically suitable areas farther south, whereas high-mountain taxa responded mainly with elevational shifts. The greatest niche similarity is found among phylogenetically closely related taxa and among ecologically similar and often sympatric taxa. The least similarity was observed in species with marked differences in habitat elevation and in more geographically isolated species. Our results suggest that the extent of range and niche overlap varied among some taxa throughout their evolutionary history, which may have led to diversification at both allopatric and sympatric levels. The correlation between the genetic diversity of the most widespread taxon and the richness of taxa could be a consequence of past and present contacts. On the other hand, alternate periods of isolation may have favoured the emergence of taxa that are reproductively isolated and ecologically specialized.},
