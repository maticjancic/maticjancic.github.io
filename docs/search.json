    "text": "Tabular data preparation and naming conventions in R\nThere is a set of R packages called tidyverse developed mostly by Hadley Wickham and described in his book R for data science (second edition). We will be using a lot of functions from tidyverse as they are very appropriate for R beginners. To use them to your maximum advantage, you need to get familiar with the concept of a tidy data frame:\n\nOne column is one variable (i.e. gender, height, age),\nOne row is one observation (for all measurements we did on one individual or any other given subject),\nOne field is one value.\n\n\n\n\nTidy dataframe template.\n\n\nIf you structure your dataframes in such a way, it will be efficiently organised and ready to be used when imported, processed and analysed by tidyverse and also base R functions. There are some other basic requirements/recommendations that your data should conform to in order to avoid problems while importing and using it:\n\ndecimal separator in must be a dot!\ncategorical variables should have consistent naming of the groups!\ncolumn names should be without spaces! (connect with underscore _)\ncolumn names must be without symbols! (i.e.: ?, $, *, +, (, ), -, /, }, {, |, &gt;, &lt; , #)\ncolumn names must not start with numbers!\nempty rows should be deleted!\ncomments should be deleted!\nusing č,š,ž,ć,đ is not recommended!\nformat date in the long format!

    "section": "What can be imported in R? How and from where?",
    "text": "What can be imported in R? How and from where?\nR supports a variety of file types to be imported, including:\n\ndataframes (saved as comma separated value files - .csv, excel spreadsheets - .xlsx, text files - .txt, google spreadsheets, etc. )\nR format files (.Rdata, .RDS)\ngeospatial data (shape files - .shp, raster files - .ASCII, .img or .tiff)\ndata from databases (i.e. MySQL)\nfiles from web or web databases through specialized packages (i.e. rgbif or sdmpredictors packages; GBIF = Global Biodiverstity Information Facility)\nfiles from other specialized statistical software (i.e. SPSS, STATA, SAS)\n\nFor importing files from the hard drive (most often .txt, .csv AND xlsx), there is a specific function that imports specific file type. For example, read.csv() is used to import comma separated values file, read.table() for text files and read_excel() for excel spreadsheets. All this functions have a common argument, we need to specify: file or path which is the location of the document you want to import on our hard-drives. There are two ways we can specify this locations:\n\nfull file path, i.e. C:\\Users\\Matic\\OneDrive - UPR\\01_FAMNIT\\02_VAJE\\2021_22\\201_sodobni pristopi\\2_Importing data and data transfomations\\01_data\\example_data.csv - not recommended.\nfile path without the working directory, i.e. 01_data\\example_data.csv - better, but not optimal.\n\nThe working directory is a default location on the hard-drive, where R “looks” for files. As we usually don’t know which one it is, we use getwd() function with empty brackets to figure it out:\n\ngetwd()\n\nIf we want to change the working directory, we use setwd() function, where we specify the location on our computers hard drive (mandatory in quotations). For example, if I want to set Desktop as working directory for my computer, I would use:\n\nsetwd(\"C:\\Users\\matic.jancic\\Desktop“)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nEach time we restart RStudio, the working directory will change back to the default. This means that for our code to work and import the data, we would need to re-run setwd() command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe preferable and recommended way to avoid potential problems with setting and resetting the working directory each time we come back to RStudio is to use R project workflow.\n\n\nWe need to create a folder on our hard-drive and assign it to an R project. An icon will appear in the folder and starting RStudio from this icon will automatically set the working directory to that particular folder. If we than keep our data, scripts and results in this folder as well, we will save ourselfs from issues associated with working directories. More info about R projects here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask: Create new R project\n\n\n\nClick on File tab in your RStudio, select New project and create new R project on your Desktop called My first R project by following the instructions bellow:\n\n\n\n\n\nNew directory.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew project.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first R project.\n\n\nGo to the Desktop of your computer and check for the new folder. What is in it?\n\n\n\nR project folder and icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate two new folders within My first R project called 01_data and 02_scripts.\nClose R studio and reopen it by using the R project icon called My first R project from the new folder.\nUse getwd() function to check your current working directory. To what is it set now?"

We must also include the file extension, .txt.\nReminders from the previous lab:\n\nthe path name is a character strings and must be contained within parenthesis \" \".\nif we want to use data after applying some function to it, we need to assign it to objects (&lt;-),\nwe are the ones that choose the names of objects (penguins in this case)\n\nTaking into account all of the above, the following code should import the penguins dataset and assign it to the penguins object:\n\npenguins &lt;- read.table(file = \"01_data/penguins.txt\") \n\nThe resulting penguins object should have 344 observations of 8 variables.\n\nLet’s continue with importing .csv file with read.csv() function.

Why does it not work?\n\n\n\niris &lt;- read.table(file = \"01_data/iris.txt\") \n\niris &lt;- read.csv(file = \"iris.csv\") \n\niris &lt;- read.csv(\"01_data/iriis.csv\")\n\nThis error means that the path to the file is not specified correctly. In plain terms, R is looking for the file which\n\nis not in the folder you specified,\ndoes not have a name you specified, or\nis not in a format you specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nDouble check the working directory, the folder where the data is stored, the name of the file and its extension:\n\n\n\n\nWith the number of rows and/or columns differs between original file and the created object\nSometimes the first row of the file, which includes column names, is treated as data when imported. When this happens, the columns will be named as V1, V2, etc. until the last column while the actual column names will be in the first row of the data, as can be seen below:\n\n\n            V1          V2           V3          V4      V5\n1 Sepal_Length Sepal_Width Petal_Length Petal_Width Species\n2          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.9           3          1.4         0.2  setosa\n4          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n5          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n6            5         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nWithin the read.csv() or read.table() include additional argument header = TRUE. This will tell R that the first row includes column names:\nread.csv(..., header = TRUE) or read.table(..., header = TRUE).\n\n\nSometimes the imported data will have only one column. When this happens the symbol that separates the values in rows was not the one R was expecting it to be, as can be seen below:\n\n\n  Sepal_Length.Sepal_Width.Petal_Length.Petal_Width.Species\n1                                    5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa\n2                                      4.9,3,1.4,0.2,setosa\n3                                    4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,setosa\n4                                    4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,setosa\n5                                      5,3.6,1.4,0.2,setosa\n6                                    5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,setosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nWe determine the symbol that separates the values from the output and set it within the read.csv() or read.table(). In this example, the separator is comma - ,, which we set with the argument sep = \",\":\nread.csv(..., sep = \",\") or read.table(..., sep = \",\").\nAnother very common separator you will encounter in the .csv files is a semicolon - ;, while in the .txt tab \\t is commonly used by program encoding. Note that the separator is included within quotations!"
