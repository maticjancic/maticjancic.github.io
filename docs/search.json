    "text": "This is me. I like being outdoors - hiking, biking, running, climbing (sometimes more, sometimes less). I also tried alpine climbing and ultra trail running. I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.\nThis is also me. I’m grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I’m disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.\nIf you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4 AM), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.\nAnd I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being .. just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:\n\nMarine Ecology,\nMarine Conservation Biology,\nEcology of terrestrial ecosystems,\nAdvanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),\nBiology and conservation of large vertebrates,\nMarine protected areas - human dimensions,\nPopulation biology,\nConservation ecology of marine mammals.\n\nUf, … and at bachelor level:\n\nBasics of using R as GIS,\nIntroductory zoology,\nBiology and diversity of vertebrates.\n\nThough I’m a “trained” biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but also like to prepare learning materials with markdown. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and so many associated tools make it super easy to so much, especially for people that are not programmers per se.\nI will finish about me section with my education. You may not know, but I’ve studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:\n\nPhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\nMsc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)\nBSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)"
