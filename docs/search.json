    "text": "This is me. I like being outdoors - hiking, biking, running, climbing (sometimes more, sometimes less). I also tried alpine climbing and ultra trail running. I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.\nThis is also me. I’m grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I’m disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.\nIf you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4 AM), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.\nAnd I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being .. just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:\n\nMarine Ecology,\nMarine Conservation Biology,\nEcology of terrestrial ecosystems,\nAdvanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),\nBiology and conservation of large vertebrates,\nMarine protected areas - human dimensions,\nPopulation biology,\nConservation ecology of marine mammals.\n\nUf, … and at bachelor level:\n\nBasics of using R as GIS,\nIntroductory zoology,\nBiology and diversity of vertebrates.\n\nThough I’m a “trained” biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but also like to prepare learning materials with markdown. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and so many associated tools make it super easy to so much, especially for people that are not programmers per se.\nI will finish about me section with my education. You may not know, but I’ve studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:\n\nPhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\nMsc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)\nBSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)"

    "text": "This is my first post using Quarto. Welcome!\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.\n\nHahaha. I’ll just leave the above in the post, so you all know it. Quarto will use the first image in the post as the one to show in the listing page.\nAt this point in time, I’m starting this blog with multiple objectives:\n\nlearn how to use quarto and use it instead of RMarkdown (I intend to remake all my teaching materials using quarto and publish online),\nget in the habit of writing more, specifically writing non-academic stuff,\nhopefully advertise myself, as I’m not sure, whether or how long I’m staying in academia,\nmaybe something else, but can’t elaborate now.\n\nAs I’m writing this lines, I don’t yet know how to publish this blog online. I will try to do it using github pages, but still need to figure it out how.\nWhat I find extremely fascinating, is how easy it is (so far) to create and adapt the pages of the website. As you will see, I added the page Publications at the top rigth corner of the page, where you can find the scientific papers that I was a (co)author of. They are stored in a bib document and cited according to Frontiers in marine science template. As it is a common practice to highlight your name, I found a very simple solution online (thank you, Neil Wright for that) and used two lua scrips (never heard before that lua exists) to do just that. My name is now automatically written with bold letters. Hurray!!\nI will conclude here with the welcome post and go figuring out, how to get this blog online. If I make, you will be able to read this lines. If not, well for now your are not missing out a lot."
