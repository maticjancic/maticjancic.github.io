I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.\nThis is also me. I’m grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I’m disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.\nIf you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4 AM), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.\nAnd I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being .. just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:\n\nMarine Ecology,\nMarine Conservation Biology,\nEcology of terrestrial ecosystems,\nAdvanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),\nBiology and conservation of large vertebrates,\nMarine protected areas - human dimensions,\nPopulation biology,\nConservation ecology of marine mammals.\n\nUf, … and at bachelor level:\n\nBasics of using R as GIS,\nIntroductory zoology,\nBiology and diversity of vertebrates.\n\nThough I’m a “trained” biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but also like to prepare learning materials with markdown. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and so many associated tools make it super easy to so much, especially for people that are not programmers per se.\nI will finish about me section with my education. You may not know, but I’ve studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:\n\nPhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\nMsc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)\nBSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)"

As you will see, I added the page Publications at the top rigth corner of the page, where you can find the scientific papers that I was a (co)author of. They are stored in a bib document and cited according to Frontiers in marine science template. As it is a common practice to highlight your name, I found a very simple solution online (thank you, Neil Wright for that) and used two lua scrips (never heard before that lua exists) to do just that. My name is now automatically written with bold letters. Hurray!!\nI will conclude here with the welcome post and go figuring out, how to get this blog online.

And with many fisherman, the after work routine is to go and have a drink when you are done. Once, I was sitting with one of them, when he starts to explain, that one of the sea turtles he caught, was very different from all others. He looked for the photo on his phone and it was obvious that we are not talking about loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, which is a common species in the area, but rather about green sea turtle Chelonia mydas (left on the photo), which was rarely to be seen in Northern Adriatic Sea. The second record came a couple of months later, when I got a call from another fisherman at 5:30 AM. He told me that there was a weird turtle with completely white plastron (belly, underside) in his nets and sent me a couple of photos (fourth in the photo, in the hand of the fisherman.\n\n\n\nPhoto credits left to right: M.

    "text": "How I was writing my first paper\nThis two photos were a starting point to writing my first scientific paper (it was back at the end of 2019). The idea was first to just publish this two new records, which were accompanied by several more from our Italian and Croatian colleagues. We also found one record in Albania supported by a good quality photo on the GBIF, which came as nice surprise. So I prepared something that resembled a manuscript, sent it to my supervisor and … didn’t hear from him for the next 12 months.\nAfter that time, I got back to the manuscript, searched the web and found a bunch of reports, which included information on sightings of green sea turtle in Adriatic Sea. After some discussion, this changed the narrative of the article and we refocused the paper not just on new sightings, but why there seem to be much more sightings since the year 2000 compared to the period before. We now had 8 new, unreported and roughly 65 reported sightings. This also enabled us to analyse the sizes and temporal distribution of animals, that were observed in the Adriatic sea. For the sake of the publication, the plots were in a more traditional, standard black and white (code at the end with all “polishing details). My friend Manja also draw a very nice sketch of the green turtle head that we added to the empty space of the plot (you can find more of her art here). For this post, I decided to use a simply plotly histogram in which I only changed the color of the bars to match the header of my webpage:\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ngreens <- read.csv(\"green_length_adr.csv\") %>% drop_na(CCL)\n\n# Plotly histogram\ngreens %>% \n  plotly::plot_ly(data = .,\n                  x = ~CCL,\n                  type = \"histogram\",\n                  marker = list(color = \"#2C3E50\")) %>% \n  plotly::layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Curved carapace length (cm)'),\n                 yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency'))"

    "text": "What did we figure out in this study?\nBased on the data we had acquired and analysed it seems that the number of green sea turtle observations in Adriatic sea increased more than tenfold between 2000 - 2020 and will likely continue to increase. We attributed this intriguing increase to:\n\nthe increase of Mediterranean green sea turtle population,\nthe increased capacity of institutes, universities and NGOs around the Adriatic resulting in higher awareness of sea turtles in the region and lastly,\nclimate change - warming seas seem to be shifting Adriatic to be more favorable for green turtles (and the animals can find many areas with food sources they need).\n\nTwo most notable areas where green turtles were most commonly observed were coasts of Albania and Southern Italy. Again, there is more traditional map in the paper, but below you can find the same data visualized using leaflet. You will note that there are two big red circles (recent observations) with the same label in Drini Bay - they simply represent the data divided in two smaller compartments (2003 - 2010 and 2011 - 2018).\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\ngreen_locs <- read.csv(\"green_locs_adr.csv\", sep = \";\",\n                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\npal <- colorFactor(palette = c(\"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n                   domain = green_locs$Period)\n\nleaflet(green_locs) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %>% \n    addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ X,\n                     lat = ~ Y,\n                     radius = 4 * sqrt(green_locs$N),\n                     stroke = FALSE,\n                     fillOpacity = 0.7,\n                     color = ~pal(Period),\n                     label = green_locs$Location) %>%\n    addLegend(pal = pal,\n              values = ~Period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe finally managed to publish this article in December 2022. From a relatively easy thing - to publish a couple of new observations of rare species, this paper turned out quite a big review of what we know about green sea turtles in Adriatic. For me personally, it was also a steep learning curve on scientific writing. When I look to the folder with my “version controlled” manuscripts (there are at least 30), I started as a complete rookie and now feel way better equipped to tackle my three paper PhD dissertation. For those interested in more information about our paper, you can find it and download it from here."

    "text": "How can you access species occurence data and what is in it?\nTo access the occurrence data we can use occ_search() function, which will contact the GBIF server and download the data from the database. For example, if you are interested in occurences of The fin whale, you would have to set the argument scientificName = \"Balaenoptera physalus\". There are many helpful arguments, that we could use, to refine our search (i.e. hasCoordinate, country, continent, etc.), but I will refrain from using them in this post. This will download the data and store in an gbif format, which is essentially a list with 5 elements. We could explore all of them, but we are mostly interested in the $data part, where coordinates and other information on the records are stored. You can explore the resulting data set in the table below the photo.\n\n\n\nFin whale (photo credit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/slobirdr/29414853626)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(rgbif)\nphysalus_gbif <- occ_search(scientificName = \"Balaenoptera physalus\")\n\nphysalus <- physalus_gbif$data \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have noted there were 500 observations included in the table (number of entries). This happens by default, if there are more than 500 occurrences in the database, as is the case for fin whales (there are 108182 occurrences; which i found out with occ_count(taxonKey = 2440718)). To access more (or less), we would need to change the paramater limit = to the desired value (100,000 is the hard maximum stated in the package vignette). Lastly, look on the map where whales from our sample were seen. Whale icons created by Good Ware - Flaticon.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(png)\n\nwhale <- makeIcon(iconUrl = \"https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2834/2834539.png\",\n                   iconWidth = 25, iconHeight = 25)\n\nleaflet(physalus) %>%\n    addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %>%\n    addMarkers(\n        lng = ~ decimalLongitude,\n        lat = ~ decimalLatitude,\n        icon = whale,\n        label = ~ country\n    )"

    "text": "How can you access taxa occurrences for a limited geographic region?\nThe following example is a result of GBIF inspection after one student expresed desire to graduate on nudibranchs (marine snails that lack shells) and do something with R (I was proud, that not all students go home in tears after my R labs 😄). First, just google nudibranchs and be amazed in what colors and shapes they come. I am showing just one that I find very interesting.\n\n\n\nPilgrim hervia Cratena peregrina (photo credit: https://commons.wikimedia.org/)\n\n\nSo, before agreeing with this student, what she could do for her bachelor thesis, I quickly looked at what is available on GBIF for our region. I found out occ_search() can be used for higher taxa as well, but not by their Latin names. One need to first find out the key of the taxa of interest (be it phylum, kingdom, class, order, familiy or genus) using name_suggest(q = \"Taxa of interest\") function. The function returns all keys that match the search string, see example below for Nudibranchia.\nTo access the Nudibranch data, we now need to specify orderKey = 980. To limited the search to Adriatic sea we can use geometry = 'POLYGON(()) argument which is very simple. I searched for multiple coordinates on Google-maps to create a polygon around the Adriatic sea and list them within the parenthesis. The thing to be aware of is that the polygon has to be closed, i.e. the first and last point must have the same coordinates.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(rgbif)\n\nnudibranch_Adriatic_gbif <- \n  occ_search(geometry = 'POLYGON((18.46 40.05, 22.03 42.26, 13.89 46.87, 8.68 46.36, 18.46 40.05))',\n             orderKey = 980,\n             limit = 5000)\n\nnudibranch_Adriatic <- nudibranch_Adriatic_gbif$data\n\nname_suggest(q = \"Nudibranchia\")\n\n\nRecords returned [3] \nNo. unique hierarchies [0] \nArgs [q=Nudibranchia, limit=100, fields1=key, fields2=canonicalName,\n     fields3=rank] \n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n      key canonicalName              rank   \n    <int> <chr>                      <chr>  \n1     980 Nudibranchia               ORDER  \n2 4329412 Thysanote nudibranchiata   SPECIES\n3 8310904 Auricularia nudibranchiata SPECIES\n\n\n\nWhen the data is downloaded, we again extract only $data part, where coordinates are stored. This inquiry yielded 518 occurences that belong to 50 different species (A list at the end of the post). You can see where they were recorded on the map below. Nudibranch icon accessed at MahaRaja Eco Dive Lodge.\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nnudibranch <-\n    makeIcon(iconUrl = \"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a55df2e9f8dce980ddb50ea/1515818936193-QIFQGV59CKSO9ZFX4GAD/Icon-09.png?format=750w\",\n             iconWidth = 25,\n             iconHeight = 25)\n\nleaflet(nudibranch_Adriatic) %>% \n     addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %>% \n     addMarkers(lat = ~decimalLatitude,\n                      lng = ~decimalLongitude,\n                      label = ~species,\n                      icon = nudibranch)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI find it fascinating and amazing what happens when people join forces and do things for common good. The GBIF is an example of just that. The data is contributed to GBIF from around 2400 different sources, that include citizen science databases (i.e. iNaturalist), Universities, Institutes, Museums, etc. And to everyone else, including you and me, it is freely available to see, navigate, use and reuse!
