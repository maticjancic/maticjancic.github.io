    "text": "This is me. I like being outdoors - hiking, biking, running, climbing (sometimes more, sometimes less). I also tried alpine climbing and ultra trail running. I have a lovely girlfriend and a 16 years younger brother. I love them both very deeply.\nThis is also me. I’m grinding as a teaching assistant and PhD student for the past (almost) 7 years. I think I like research, but I’m disappointed by precariousness of the job, (too) long hours and (too) low pay.\nIf you wonder what I do, I study sea turtles (and sharks to a lesser extent). You will think that this is exciting and amazing. And it is, most of the time at least. I spent three whole summers on fishing boats (starting at 3 - 4 AM), I flew a DJI Phantom 4 PRO drone over the sea and glued multiple satellite and GPS-GSM tags (and twice both at the same time) on the backs of sea turtles to figure out where they are going and what they are doing.\nAnd I teach at the University. This in Slovenia apparently means, that as a teaching assistant you are all knowing being .. just look at the list of the classes I am or was teaching (mostly practicals though). At master level that is:\n\nMarine Ecology,\nMarine Conservation Biology,\nEcology of terrestrial ecosystems,\nAdvanced topics in Conservation biology (in which I teach Introduction to R),\nBiology and conservation of large vertebrates,\nMarine protected areas - human dimensions,\nPopulation biology,\nConservation ecology of marine mammals.\n\nUf, … and at bachelor level:\n\nBasics of using R as GIS,\nIntroductory zoology,\nBiology and diversity of vertebrates.\n\nThough I’m a “trained” biologist, I spend most of my time behind the computer. Self taught on how to use R for many different things, including of course, analysis and visualizations, but also like to prepare learning materials with markdown. Additionally, I have one failed attempt at building my own website a couple of years ago. I find it super interesting, how R and so many associated tools make it super easy to so much, especially for people that are not programmers per se.\nI will finish about me section with my education. You may not know, but I’ve studied at 75% of public Slovenian Universities:\n\nPhD in Biological Sciences, Enrolled (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\nMsc Nature Conservation, 2015 (University of Primorska, Slovenia)\nBSc in Ecology and Nature Conservation, 2012 (University of Maribor, Slovenia)"

I’ll just leave the above in the post, so you all know it. Quarto will use the first image in the post as the one to show in the listing page.\nAt this point in time, I’m starting this blog with multiple objectives:\n\nlearn how to use quarto and use it instead of RMarkdown (I intend to remake all my teaching materials using quarto and publish online),\nget in the habit of writing more, specifically writing non-academic stuff,\nhopefully advertise myself, as I’m not sure, whether or how long I’m staying in academia,\nmaybe something else, but can’t elaborate now.\n\nAs I’m writing this lines, I don’t yet know how to publish this blog online. I will try to do it using github pages, but still need to figure it out how.\nWhat I find extremely fascinating, is how easy it is (so far) to create and adapt the pages of the website. As you will see, I added the page Publications at the top rigth corner of the page, where you can find the scientific papers that I was a (co)author of. They are stored in a bib document and cited according to Frontiers in marine science template. As it is a common practice to highlight your name, I found a very simple solution online (thank you, Neil Wright for that) and used two lua scrips (never heard before that lua exists) to do just that. My name is now automatically written with bold letters. Hurray!!\nI will conclude here with the welcome post and go figuring out, how to get this blog online. If I make, you will be able to read this lines. If not, well for now your are not missing out a lot."

And with many fisherman, the after work routine is to go and have a drink when you are done. Once, I was sitting with one of them, when he starts to explain, that one of the sea turtles he caught, was very different from all others. He looked for the photo on his phone and it was obvious that we are not talking about loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, which is a common species in the area, but rather about green sea turtle Chelonia mydas (left on the photo), which was rarely to be seen in Northern Adriatic Sea. The second record came a couple of months later, when I got a call from another fisherman at 5:30 AM. He told me that there was a weird turtle with completely white plastron (belly, underside) in his nets and sent me a couple of photos (fourth in the photo, in the hand of the fisherman.\n\n\n\nPhoto credits left to right: M.

    "text": "How I was writing my first paper\nThis two photos were a starting point to writing my first scientific paper (it was back at the end of 2019). The idea was first to just publish this two new records, which were accompanied by several more from our Italian and Croatian colleagues. We also found one record in Albania supported by a good quality photo on the GBIF, which came as nice surprise. So I prepared something that resembled a manuscript, sent it to my supervisor and … didn’t hear from him for the next 12 months.\nAfter that time, I got back to the manuscript, searched the web and found a bunch of reports, which included information on sightings of green sea turtle in Adriatic Sea. After some discussion, this changed the narrative of the article and we refocused the paper not just on new sightings, but why there seem to be much more sightings since the year 2000 compared to the period before. We now had 8 new, unreported and roughly 65 reported sightings. This also enabled us to analyse the sizes and temporal distribution of animals, that were observed in the Adriatic sea. For the sake of the publication, the plots were in a more traditional, standard black and white (code at the end with all “polishing details). My friend Manja also draw a very nice sketch of the green turtle head that we added to the empty space of the plot (you can find more of her art here). For this post, I decided to use a simply plotly histogram in which I only changed the color of the bars to match the header of my webpage:\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ngreens <- read.csv(\"green_length_adr.csv\") %>% drop_na(CCL)\n\n# Plotly histogram\ngreens %>% \n  plotly::plot_ly(data = .,\n                  x = ~CCL,\n                  type = \"histogram\",\n                  marker = list(color = \"#2C3E50\")) %>% \n  plotly::layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Curved carapace length (cm)'),\n                 yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency'))"

    "text": "What did we figure out in this study?\nBased on the data we had acquired and analysed it seems that the number of green sea turtle observations in Adriatic sea increased more than tenfold between 2000 - 2020 and will likely continue to increase. We attributed this intriguing increase to:\n\nthe increase of Mediterranean green sea turtle population,\nthe increased capacity of institutes, universities and NGOs around the Adriatic resulting in higher awareness of sea turtles in the region and lastly,\nclimate change - warming seas seem to be shifting Adriatic to be more favorable for green turtles (and the animals can find many areas with food sources they need).\n\nTwo most notable areas where green turtles were most commonly observed were coasts of Albania and Southern Italy. Again, there is more traditional map in the paper, but below you can find the same data visualized using leaflet. You will note that there are two big red circles (recent observations) with the same label in Drini Bay - they simply represent the data divided in two smaller compartments (2003 - 2010 and 2011 - 2018).\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\ngreen_locs <- read.csv(\"green_locs_adr.csv\", sep = \";\",\n                       stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\npal <- colorFactor(palette = c(\"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n                   domain = green_locs$Period)\n\nleaflet(green_locs) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\") %>% \n    addCircleMarkers(lng = ~ X,\n                     lat = ~ Y,\n                     radius = 4 * sqrt(green_locs$N),\n                     stroke = FALSE,\n                     fillOpacity = 0.7,\n                     color = ~pal(Period),\n                     label = green_locs$Location) %>%\n    addLegend(pal = pal,\n              values = ~Period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe finally managed to publish this article in December 2022. From a relatively easy thing - to publish a couple of new observations of rare species, this paper turned out quite a big review of what we know about green sea turtles in Adriatic. For me personally, it was also a steep learning curve on scientific writing. When I look to the folder with my “version controlled” manuscripts (there are at least 30), I started as a complete rookie and now feel way better equipped to tackle my three paper PhD dissertation. For those interested in more information about our paper, you can find it and download it from here."

I used ggplot2 to create both graphs and polish them mostly within the theme() function. The major adaptations were removing axis labels, titles and ticks, so they are not duplicated. Also, I reduced white space around both plots with plot.margin =.
